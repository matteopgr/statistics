        To formally demonstrate why the median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations, we can follow a simple mathematical approach. Let's consider a set of data points \( x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \) arranged in increasing order. We aim to show that the median is the value of \( c \) that minimizes the sum of the absolute deviations from \( c \):
    </p>

    <p>
        \[
        S(c) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - c|
        \]
    </p>

    <h1>1. Case of Two Points:</h1>

    <p>
        First, consider the simplest case where we have just two points \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \). We want to minimize the sum of absolute deviations:
    </p>

    <p>
        \[
        S(c) = |x_1 - c| + |x_2 - c|
        \]
    </p>

    <p>
        The function \( |x_1 - c| + |x_2 - c| \) is minimized when \( c \) is between \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) or at one of them. Specifically, the minimum occurs at the median of the two points, which is \( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} \) for even numbers, or one of the middle points for odd.
    </p>

    <h1>2. General Case:</h1>

    <p>
        Now, letâ€™s extend this to \( n \) points, where \( n \) can be either even or odd. The function we want to minimize is:
    </p>

    <p>
        \[
        S(c) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - c|
        \]
    </p>

    <p>
        We can break this problem into two cases based on the position of \( c \) relative to the data points.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Case \( c \leq x_1 \):</strong> In this case, \( |x_i - c| = x_i - c \) for all \( i \). Thus, the function \( S(c) \) becomes:
        </p>
    
        <p>
            \[
            S(c) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - c) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i - nc
            \]
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Here, \( S(c) \) is a linear function that decreases as \( c \) increases. Therefore, to minimize \( S(c) \), \( c \) must be increased, and thus the minimum cannot be achieved for \( c \leq x_1 \).
        </p>
      </li>  
      <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Case \( c \geq x_n \):</strong> In this case, \( |x_i - c| = c - x_i \) for all \( i \). Thus, \( S(c) \) becomes:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[
            S(c) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (c - x_i) = nc - \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
            \]
        </p>

        <p>
            This     is also a linear function, but it increases as \( c \) increases. Hence, \( S(c) \) decreases as \( c \) decreases, and the minimum cannot occur for \( c \geq x_n \).
        </p>    
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Case \( x_k \leq c \leq x_{k+1} \) for some \( k \):</strong> For \( c \) in between data points, the behavior of \( S(c) \) changes. Specifically, \( S(c) \) increases for values greater than the median and decreases for values less than the median. This happens because each \( |x_i - c| \) term contributes differently depending on whether \( c \) is above or below the data points.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    

    

    <h1>3. Conclusion:</h1>

    <p>
        The absolute deviation is minimized when \( c \) is the value that balances the number of data points on either side. This is exactly the median of the dataset:
    </p>

    <p>
        - For odd \( n \), the median is the middle value, \( x_{(n+1)/2} \). <br>
        - For even \( n \), the median is any value between the two middle points.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thus, the median minimizes the sum of the absolute deviations:
    </p>

    <p>
        \[
        S(c) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - c|
        \]
    </p>

    <p>
        This completes the formal proof that the median is the value of \( c \) that minimizes the sum of the absolute deviations.
