    <h2>Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and Its Relationship with Density Functions and Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs)</h2>
    <p>
        The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) provides a bridge between differentiation and integration, stating that if \( f(x) \) is continuous over an interval \( [a, b] \) and \( F(x) \) is an antiderivative of \( f(x) \) on that interval, then:
    </p>
    <p>
        \[ F(x) = \int_a^x f(t) \, dt \]
    </p>
    <p>
        and hence
    </p>
    <p>
        \[ F'(x) = f(x). \]
    </p>
    <p>
        This theorem can be applied to probability theory, where it plays a significant role in connecting a cumulative distribution function (CDF) and a probability density function (PDF).
    </p>
    <p>
        In probability, if \( X \) is a continuous random variable with CDF \( F(x) \), which represents the probability that \( X \) takes a value less than or equal to \( x \), we define:
    </p>
    <p>
        \[ F(x) = P(X \leq x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f(t) \, dt, \]
    </p>
    <p>
        where \( f(x) \) is the probability density function (PDF) of \( X \).
    </p>
    <p>
        By the FTC, differentiating \( F(x) \) with respect to \( x \) yields the PDF:
    </p>
    <p>
        \[ f(x) = F'(x). \]
    </p>
    <p>
        This shows that the PDF is the derivative of the CDF. Consequently, if we know the CDF of a continuous random variable, we can find its PDF by differentiation, and if we know the PDF, we can find the CDF by integration.
