    <h2>Independence vs. Uncorrelation</h2>

    <p><b>Independence</b> and <b>uncorrelation</b> are two fundamental concepts in probability and statistics that describe relationships between random variables, but they have different meanings and implications.</p>

    <h3>Independence</h3>

    <p>Two random variables \( X \) and \( Y \) are said to be <b>independent</b> if knowing the value of one variable provides no information about the value of the other. Mathematically, this is defined by:</p>

    <p>
    \[
    P(X = x \text{ and } Y = y) = P(X = x) P(Y = y),
    \]
    </p>

    <p>or equivalently, for their joint probability density functions, \( f_{X,Y}(x, y) = f_X(x) f_Y(y) \). In this case, the variables are "free" from each other in the probabilistic sense, and knowing the distribution of one does not help in predicting the distribution of the other.</p>

    <h3>Uncorrelation</h3>

    <p>Two random variables \( X \) and \( Y \) are <b>uncorrelated</b> if their <b>covariance</b> is zero, which implies that there is no linear relationship between them. The covariance between \( X \) and \( Y \) is defined by:</p>

    <p>
    \[
    \operatorname{Cov}(X, Y) = \mathbb{E}[(X - \mathbb{E}[X])(Y - \mathbb{E}[Y])].
    \]
    </p>

    <p>If \( \operatorname{Cov}(X, Y) = 0 \), then \( X \) and \( Y \) are uncorrelated. The correlation coefficient \( \rho(X, Y) \), which is the normalized form of covariance, is also zero in this case:</p>

    <p>
    \[
    \rho(X, Y) = \frac{\operatorname{Cov}(X, Y)}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y} = 0,
    \]
    </p>

    <p>where \( \sigma_X \) and \( \sigma_Y \) are the standard deviations of \( X \) and \( Y \), respectively.</p>

    <h3>Key Differences</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Implications</b>: Independence implies uncorrelation, but the reverse is not true. If \( X \) and \( Y \) are independent, then their covariance (and hence correlation) is zero. However, uncorrelated variables are not necessarily independent.</li>
        <li><b>Linear vs. Non-linear Relationships</b>: Uncorrelation only indicates the absence of a linear relationship between \( X \) and \( Y \). They may still have a non-linear dependency. For example, if \( Y = X^2 \), then \( X \) and \( Y \) are uncorrelated (assuming \( X \) is symmetric about zero), but they are clearly dependent because knowing \( X \) gives information about \( Y \).</li>
        <li><b>Measures</b>: Independence is measured by checking if the joint distribution factorizes into marginal distributions. Uncorrelation is measured by the covariance or correlation coefficient.</li>
    </ul>
